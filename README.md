# Getting Started
To use the fitness helper chatbot, you will need to have access to an internet-connected device with a web browser. Simply navigate to the website where the chatbot is hosted and begin chatting with the bot. The chatbot will ask you a series of questions about your fitness goals, dietary preferences, and current fitness level in order to generate a personalized program for you.

# How it Works
The chatbot uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand the user's inputs and generate personalized responses. The NLP algorithms enable the chatbot to interpret the user's text inputs, while the machine learning algorithms enable the chatbot to generate responses based on the data it has been trained on.

When a user begins a chat with the bot, the bot will greet the user and ask a series of questions to gather information about their fitness goals, dietary preferences, and current fitness level. Based on this information, the bot will generate a personalized diet and fitness program for the user. The bot will then provide the user with daily reminders and motivational messages to help them stay on track with their program.
